## Documentation

### Privacy Information

This personal build has no location permission at all: it never reads your device location. The weather is fetched for one place that you choose in the widget settings. About every 90 minutes the coordinates of that place, along with your IP address, are shared with the weather provider ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)) to retrieve updated weather information. The chosen place is stored on your device and is excluded from backups (app backup is disabled). When you search for a place by name, the text you type and your system language are sent to the Open-Meteo geocoding API; nothing is sent while you are not searching. You can view the data exchanged with the weather provider by long-pressing the **Build number** in the widget settings.

### Usage

This app does not provide a launcher icon. It is a widget-only application. To use it, add the widget to your home screen via the Android widget picker.

### Widget Configuration

Normally, your home app should allow you to reconfigure the widget (e.g., by long-pressing it). If your home app does not support widget reconfiguration, you can add a second Pimi widget to the home screen to bring up the configuration window.

The widget uses the temperature unit from your Android system settings by default. To override this setting, open the hidden widget settings by tapping the **Build number** three times and select your preferred temperature unit.

### Weather Display

The widget displays the forecast for the next 15 minutes as the current weather. It refreshes every 30 minutes. Forecast data for the next 6 hours is downloaded every 90 minutes, allowing the widget to show accurate weather for up to 6 hours without an internet connection. If the widget cannot retrieve new weather data for more than 6 hours (e.g., while in airplane mode), it will disable the weather display until internet access is available again. If the internet is unavailable for an extended period, the widget may take some minutes to sync and display weather data.

### Weather Location

The widget does not use your device location. Turn on **Weather** in the widget settings (or tap **Weather location**) and either search for a place by name or enter its latitude and longitude. The weather of that place is shown until you choose another one. Place names come from the Open-Meteo geocoding API, which is based on [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/).

### Weather and Calendar Apps

Tapping the date or weather area on the widget opens your calendar or weather app, respectively. Your preferred weather app can be selected in the widget settings. Weather apps must be explicitly whitelisted to be supported. If your preferred weather app is not yet supported, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/kolakek/pimi-widget/issues) to have it added.

Currently supported weather apps include: Pimi weather (built-in), Pixel Weather, Breezy Weather, Météo-France, KNMI, DWD WarnWetter, Met Office, Aemet, MeteoSwiss, Yr, BOM Weather, WeatherCAN, DMI Vejr, and many more...

### Troubleshooting

You can find debug information by long-pressing the **Build number** in the widget settings and checking the **Last work status**. The following are the typical statuses and their meanings:

- **WorkComplete:** The widget was updated with recent weather information. No new weather data needed to be downloaded.

- **DataUpdateComplete:** The widget was updated with recent weather information. New weather data was successfully downloaded.

- **NetworkUnavailable:** The widget was unable to fetch new weather data because the internet was unavailable. It will continue updating using the available forecast data until the internet becomes available again.

- **LocationUnavailableException:** No weather location is set. Choose one in the widget settings. See the Weather Location section above.

- **Other exceptions:** Most exceptions are likely related to network issues. The widget will continue updating using the available forecast data until the internet becomes available again.
